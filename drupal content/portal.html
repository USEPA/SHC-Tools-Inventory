<h2 class="title" id="read-title">The Tool Inventory</h2>

<p>Supported by EPA's <a href="https://www.epa.gov/aboutepa/about-sustainable-and-healthy-communities-research-program">Sustainable and Healthy Communities Research Program (SHCRP)</a> this inventory provide data, model scenarios, and narratives that guide the user through decision-making processes in ways that promote sustainability at the community level. The current inventory contains 110 tools, but the content pool will expand and contract as new tools are added and old tools are phased out. If any links to tools appear broken or missing, please let us know.</p>

<p>The tools in the inventory occupy the following four decision sectors:</p>

<dl>
	<dt class="bold"><strong>Buildings and Related Infrastructure</strong></dt>
	<dd>Decisions around buildings, like green building, or infrastructure, like stormwater management designs or extension of sewer.</dd>
	<dt class="bold"><strong>Land Use</strong></dt>
	<dd>Decisions around zoning, development, parks, etc.</dd>
	<dt class="bold"><strong>Transportation</strong></dt>
	<dd>Decisions around roads, transit, bike/pedestrian infrastructure, etc.</dd>
	<dt class="bold"><strong>Waste Disposal</strong></dt>
	<dd>Decisions around waste management, and options to avoid landfilling waste, like recycling, composting or programs to divert wasted food or “ugly produce.”</dd>
</dl>

<p>The inventory of tools is kept in the Registry of EPA Applications, models, and Data-warehouses(READ). READ is a comprehensive registry of informational resources for the EPA. General information about READ is <a href="https://ofmpub.epa.gov/sor_internet/registry/systmreg/home/overview/home.do">here</a>. The inventory is accessed using <a href="https://ofmpub.epa.gov/readwebservices/">READ Web Services</a>.</p>

<h2 class="title" id="finder-title">Guided Search</h2>

<p>Go to <a href="/node/211043">Guided Search</a>.</p>

<h3 class="title" id="what-is-wizard">What is it?</h3>

<p>The Guided Search is an interactive online search engine. It provides an intuitive way for users to search for relevant tools designed to support sustainable and healthy communities.</p>

<h3 class="title" id="why-need-wizard">Why do I need it?</h3>

<p>The tool inventory contains tools designed for practitioners and decision makers. The Guided Search guides users in locating directed tools based on their unique objectives and interests.</p>

<h3 class="title" id="how-to-wizard">How do I use it?</h3>

<p>Using a guided search engine, users narrow their search for tools by identifying their role within the community (Who are you?), specifying their objectives (What do you want to accomplish?), and selecting the relevant concepts that correspond to directed tools (Where do you want to direct your focus?).</p>

<h3 class="title" id="based-wizard">How does it work?</h3>

<div class="row cols-1">
	<div class="col">
		<p>The Guided Search is build on top of the Decision Path Library (DPL). The DPL is a database that organizes elements of environmental management decisions. The database categorizes and relates information on <em>who</em> is making a decision, <em>what objectives</em> are being accomplished, <em>what management options</em> are being used to accomplish the objectives, and <em>how</em> progress can be measured using indicators and available data.</p>

		<p>READ tools are tagged with concepts taken from the DPL. We use your selected roles and objectives to determine related concepts. This allows us to provide a list of tools relevent to accomplishing your objectives.</p>

<h2 class="title" id="search-title">Keyword Search</h2>

<p>Go to <a href="/node/211046">Keyword Search</a>.</p>

<p>Keyword Search is used to search for text in a tool's title, acronym, keywords, or description. Advanced search lets users search for text contained in titles, acronyms, descriptions, keywords, model-inputs, or output-variables. Advanced search lets users require that tools</p>

<ul>
	<li>occupy a selected decision-sector,</li>
	<li>operate within a selected environment,</li>
	<li>cost a specified amount, and</li>
	<li>pertain to a specified spatial extent.</li>
</ul>

<p>Keyword Search has an autocomplete feature that helps users explore what text is present.</p>

<p>Keyword Search works by searching for matches in the acronym, name, description, or keywords fields in the READ tool inventory.</p>
