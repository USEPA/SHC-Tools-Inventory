      <p>The Sustainable Communities Tool Finder is an interactive wizard that allows users to search for relevant tools designed to support sustainable and healthy communities.</p>
      <p>Users may narrow their search for tools by specifying their role in the community (e.g. Developer), choosing from a list of objectives of interest (e.g. “Maximize health and safety”), and finally outputting a list of tools selected by relevant concepts (e.g. “Health & Safety”).</p>
      <p>Users can expand and narrow their search at each stage in the wizard by selecting greater or fewer roles, objectives, or concepts.</p>

                      <em>Need help?</em> <strong>CONCEPTS</strong> (e.g. “Health & Safety”) are distinct focal areas that you and other decision makers can address with directed tools. Ask yourself: “In what focal areas do I identify a need for a tool or resource?” Select the concept(s) that most specifically describes the focal area where a tool will be helpful to you. Expand your search for tools by selecting additional concepts.
