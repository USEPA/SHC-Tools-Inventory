2017.04.01 - David Rebhuhn was asked to use the program as some community-stakeholder in some scenario of his choice
- One semi-confusing aspect of this program is that certain tools that are listed are duplicated. When I get to the 'results' tab, it says there are 5 results, but I count 10 entries. When I highlight one of the duplicated entries, it toggles selection of the first entry rather than the duplicate entry.
- After a few searches, this has gone up to ~30 results, and the first 5 results never change.
- Also, I can't proceed when I select the following for Role, Subrole, and Fundamental Objective: Landowner/Homeowner >> Homeowner occupant - resident that owns home >> Maximize economic prosperity and benefits.
2017.04.24 - Rick Debbout reviewed the program once looking for GIS-tools and repeatedly for general review
- "[when reading about keyword-search, I want to search for keywords. Put it there.]"
- "[Don't show absent data.]"
- "[lots of text before app]"
- "[details button imposing and large]"
- "[What is supposed to happen between find and display results?]"
- "People are fiends. [Put keyword-search immediately after the link to it.]"
- "[Breadcrumbs from index.html are a good idea.]"
2017.05.03 - Colleen Barr tested the tool quickly in her two chosen scenarios of role, subrole, fundamental objective,...
- Colleen: "Can you clear saved results?"
- Colleen: "[toast's animation was distracting]"
