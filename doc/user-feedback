2017.04.01 - David Rebhuhn was asked to use the program as some community-stakeholder in some scenario of his choice
- One semi-confusing aspect of this program is that certain tools that are listed are duplicated. When I get to the 'results' tab, it says there are 5 results, but I count 10 entries. When I highlight one of the duplicated entries, it toggles selection of the first entry rather than the duplicate entry.
- After a few searches, this has gone up to ~30 results, and the first 5 results never change.
- Also, I can't proceed when I select the following for Role, Subrole, and Fundamental Objective: Landowner/Homeowner >> Homeowner occupant - resident that owns home >> Maximize economic prosperity and benefits.
