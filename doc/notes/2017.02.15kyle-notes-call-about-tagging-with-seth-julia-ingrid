- best practice: tag narrowly, make as few leaps possible
  - broad labeling can make tagging meaningless
- best practice: document selection criteria for tagging while tagging
- look up unkown terms
- look at large institutions as resources(peer reviewed papers' abstracts,...)
- update  DPL from Ingrid before tagging
- links not in DPL but
- Ingrid: tagging with only concepts tied to an objective limits functionality
  - Ingrid: better to tag with all concepts
- Ingrid and Julia include search for relevant concepts in system sketch
