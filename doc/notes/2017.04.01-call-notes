# Kyle's notes from the call
=======================================================================
- how long did the process take beta-tester?
- were the results acceptable to beta-testers?
- possibly inform whether a button will show more or less results
- connect actions to outcomes of actions in instructions
- longer explanations on index.html or a dedicated page
- possibly attach toasts to triggering element
- find tools should maybe show tools immediately
  - at least reword the button to show tools for clarity of action
- make obvious, maybe next to the next button, that a new set of tools has been found
