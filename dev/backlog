backlog to track work to be done and by whom
=====================================================
= USAGE BELOW =======================================
=====================================================

  - who do what
  - someone: something said
=====================================================
= EXAMPLES BELOW ====================================
=====================================================

- something needs to happen outside the code
  - kyle: I think this is a good use of the backlog because it would otherwise go undocumented.
=====================================================
= BACKLOG BELOW =====================================
=====================================================

	  height: 0;
	}
	- seth: completed

 - add "jump to top" links
	- seth: completed

- disable unusable tabs
  - inform user why not usable
  	- this was stubbed as a console.log() suggestion to consider a good implementation of this

- scrape result text for urls
	- validate urls
	- create anchor
  - kyle: I have implemented a method in readSafe to markup URLs and email addresses
  - kyle: some emails seem obfuscated
=====================================================
= COMPLETE ^=========================================
=====================================================

- provide Allen with contacts for records not in a decision-sector and not tagged "Sustainable Comm"

- Why are LISA, BASINS, and SWMM absent from READ?
  - kyle: LISA appears deprecated
  - kyle email John Harman about why BASINS and SWMM appear absent
    - resolution: the tools were not visible from an internet-search in System of Registries(SOR or SoR), but an extranet-search finds these tools
    - John: possibly not visible on internet-search because the stewards weren't pushed to make the data public
  - kyle: this reveals relevant records can be hidden in READ
  - kyle: LISA, BASINS, and SWMM should be assigned decision-sectors
  - seth: spreadsheet comparing values on READ and in Tool spreadsheet sent to allen
  - seth: do we need to just update decision sector, or also additional metadata?

- WARM and MOVES not in decision-sectors
  - seth send allen an EPA contact(PIRS or IMO) for each
  - seth: spreadsheet comparing values on READ and in Tool spreadsheet sent to allen
  - seth: do we need to just update decision sector, or also additional metadata?

- FASOM GHG, GTM Model, ReEDS were added to READ by others and given a value in field DECISION_SECTOR
  - allen: others should be allowed to add records to the shc-tools-inventory's search-results by populating this field  
  - who do what action?

- specify filetype-specific actions for diffing
  - specify in .gitattributes
  - see documentation: https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Attributes#Binary-Files

- restyle mockup:
  - kyle: borders suggest associations between groups of elements
  - place border on div.main-column to enclose application
  - 
  - containerDiv.style {
      padding: 0.5em;
      border: 0.5em solid rgb(214, 215, 217);
      border-radius: 1em;
    }
  - li.style {
    }
   - 

- anchor next button or remove next button

- display related concepts, tools, and other labels

- document both READ-fields steward-tag and decision-sector
