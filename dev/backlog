=====================================================

- provide Allen with contacts for records not in a decision-sector and not tagged "Sustainable Comm"
  - create tool to script finding records added to the SHC-tools-inventory by others
    - these tools will have a decision-sector
    - these tools will not be tagged "Sustainable Comm"
    - return READ ID, title, acronym, description, decision-sector, and contact
    - let maintainers add new records to the statically defined list of records in the SHC-tools-inventory

- Why are LISA, BASINS, and SWMM absent from READ?
  - kyle: LISA appears deprecated
  - kyle email John Harman about why BASINS and SWMM appear absent
    - kyle: the tools were not visible from an internet-search in System of Registries(SOR or SoR),
            but an extranet-search in SoR finds these tools
      - a box must be checked to do an extranet-search
    - John: possibly not visible on internet-search because the stewards weren't pushed to make the data public
  - kyle: this reveals relevant records can be hidden in READ
  - kyle: LISA, BASINS, and SWMM should be assigned decision-sectors
  - seth: spreadsheet comparing values on READ and in Tool spreadsheet sent to allen
  - seth: do we need to just update decision sector, or also additional metadata?

- WARM and MOVES have no decision-sectors
  - seth send allen an EPA contact(PIRS or IMO) for each
  - seth: spreadsheet comparing values on READ and in Tool spreadsheet sent to allen
  - seth: do we need to just update decision sector, or also additional metadata?

- FASOM GHG, GTM Model, ReEDS were added to READ by others and given a decision-sector
  - allen: others should be allowed to add records to the shc-tools-inventory's search-results by populating this field  
  - who?

- specify filetype-specific actions for diffing
  - specify in .gitattributes
  - see documentation: https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Attributes#Binary-Files

- display related concepts, tools, and other labels

- stub developer documentation
  - html coding style,
  - css coding style,
  - javascript coding style,
  - git style,
  - backend interfaces,
    - READ Web Services,
    - System of Registries record-management,
      - extranet search,
  - READ's structure and function,
    - document both READ-fields steward-tag and decision-sector
      - describe how these fields are used by the project
    - create a mapping of the used fields
      - explain fields when useful
  - documentation style,
  - kyle: WIP

- update README.md
