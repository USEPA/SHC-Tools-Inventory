- provide Allen with contacts for records not in a decision-sector and not tagged "Sustainable Comm"
  - create tool to script finding tools added by others
    - these tools will have a decision-sector
    - these tools will not be tagged "Sustainable Comm"
    - return READ ID, title, acronym, description, decision-sector, and contact

- Why are LISA, BASINS, and SWMM absent from READ?
  - kyle: LISA appears deprecated
  - kyle email John Harman about why BASINS and SWMM appear absent
    - resolution: the tools were not visible from an internet-search in System of Registries(SOR or SoR), but an extranet-search finds these tools
    - John: possibly not visible on internet-search because the stewards weren't pushed to make the data public
  - kyle: this reveals relevant records can be hidden in READ
  - kyle: LISA, BASINS, and SWMM should be assigned decision-sectors
  - seth: spreadsheet comparing values on READ and in Tool spreadsheet sent to allen
  - seth: do we need to just update decision sector, or also additional metadata?

- WARM and MOVES not in decision-sectors
  - seth send allen an EPA contact(PIRS or IMO) for each
  - seth: spreadsheet comparing values on READ and in Tool spreadsheet sent to allen
  - seth: do we need to just update decision sector, or also additional metadata?

- FASOM GHG, GTM Model, ReEDS were added to READ by others and given a decision-sector
  - allen: others should be allowed to add records to the shc-tools-inventory's search-results by populating this field  
  - who do what action?

- specify filetype-specific actions for diffing
  - specify in .gitattributes
  - see documentation: https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Attributes#Binary-Files

- kyle float next button in lower right, surround with whitespace, and distinguish with more prominent border

- display related concepts, tools, and other labels

- document both READ-fields steward-tag and decision-sector
