The Envirofacts information system makes environmental information readily accessible to help ensure that the public, federal, state, tribal, and local agency partners have accurate, timely information to make sound environmental decisions. The Envirofacts system allows its users, such as environmental professionals, the regulated community, citizens groups, States, and EPA employees, to obtain easy, one-stop access to cross-media environmental data through EPA s Web environment. Other advanced EPA systems, like Web CMS, Portal, Meta data and XML Registries and other commercial and Federal systems, have laid the foundation and lower the risk of failure of the enhancements to Envirofacts with increased assurance that OIAA investments will support EPA s data architecture and data delivery and accessibility. Envirofacts continues to provide the Office-based functionality with improvements thru technology adaptation and more efficient of use and data accessing and sharing, while adding more data and adapting the EPA Target Architecture. Future funding will be aimed toward continued successful and ongoing Operations and Maintenance (O&M), including planned Envirofacts Redesign enhancements. Enhancements include (but may not be limited to) the re-design of Envirofacts search and reporting functionality, and updated EPA template design. Planned work will also include continued optimization of database structures and service enabled data via its RESTful service API, allowing developers more accessibility to Envirofacts data. Improved and enhanced download capabilities will provide added flexibility; with API links that can enable direct integration of report data into other tools or applications. Big Data technology/functionality, and enhanced visualization tools and strategies will be investigated for potential search/analytical capability enhancements, and improved reporting platforms. And Envirofacts Mobile will continue to provide access (via mobile platforms) to the wealth of program data contained within the Envirofacts Data Warehouse.","Decision Sector":"No Data","URL":"http://www.epa.gov/enviro; http://intranet.epa.gov/enviro","Life Cycle Phase":"Operations and Maintenance","BaseCost":"No Data","AnnualCost":"No Data","Other Cost Considerations":"No Data","Open Source":"No Data","Operating Environment":"No Data","Operating System":"No Data","Other Requirements":"No Data","Time Scale":"No Data","Spatial Extent":"No Data","Technical Skills Needed":"No Data","Model Structure":"No Data","Model Inputs":"No Data","Input Data Requirements":"No Data","Model Output Types":"No Data","Output Variables":"No Data","Model Evaluation":"No Data","Keywords":"AIRS, BMS, BRS, CERCLIS, ERAMS, GICS, IGD, OEI, P2, PCS, RADNET, RCRAINFO, RMP, SDWIS, TRI, TRI EXPLORER, TSCA","Support Name":"No Data","Support Email":"No Data","Support Phone":"No Data","Support Materials":"No Data","Last Software Update":"No Data","Last Modified":"03/06/2018 05:40:27 PM","Ownership Type":"Internal","Resource Type":"System or Application","Alternate Names":"No Data"},"43":{"ID":43,"Title":"Facility Registry Service","Acronym":"FRS","Description":"The Facility Registry Service (FRS) is a centrally managed database that identifies facilities either subject to environmental regulations or of environmental interest.

In addition, because it is Web-based, CDX provides users with instantaneous acknowledgment of all electronic filings received; such feedback is very important to EPA's stakeholders. A cornerstone of EPA`s e-government initiative, CDX currently accepts data for certain air, water, waste, and toxics programs and will gradually expand to support all Agency environmental reporting.

AQUATOX simulates multiple environmental stressors (including nutrients, organic loadings and chemicals, and temperature) and their effects on the algal, macrophyte, invertebrate, and fish communities. AQUATOX simulates the transfer of biomass, energy and chemicals from one compartment of the ecosystem to another. It does this by simultaneously computing each of the most important chemical or biological processes for each day of the simulation period. Therefore, AQUATOX can help identify and understand the cause and effect relationships between chemical water quality, the physical environment, and aquatic life. AQUATOX can represent a variety of aquatic ecosystems, including vertically stratified lakes, reservoirs and ponds, rivers and streams, mesocosms and estuaries. AQUATOX can be used in a number of ways to address water management issues and programs. AQUATOX should be considered when the user needs to understand the processes relating the chemical and physical environment to the biological community. Some examples of potential analyses include: ecological risk assessment of toxic organics and pesticides; development of water quality targets for nutrients; prediction of fish tissue concentrations of toxic substances such as PCBs; evaluation of which of several stressors is causing biological impairment; evaluation of effects of invasive species and climate change; evaluation of proposed management actions. AQUATOX is a simulation model for aquatic systems. AQUATOX predicts the fate of various pollutants, such as nutrients and organic chemicals, and their effects on the ecosystem, including fish, invertebrates, and aquatic plants. This model is a valuable tool for ecologists, biologists, water quality modelers, and anyone involved in performing ecological risk assessments for aquatic ecosystems. AQUATOX can predict not only the environmental fate of chemicals in aquatic ecosystems, but also their direct and indirect effects on the resident organisms. Therefore it has the potential to establish causal links between chemical water quality and biological response and aquatic life uses.","Decision Sector":"No Data","URL":"http://water.epa.gov/scitech/datait/models/aquatox/","Life Cycle Phase":"Operations and Maintenance","BaseCost":"No Data","AnnualCost":"No Data","Other Cost Considerations":"No Data","Open Source":"No Data","Operating Environment":"No Data","Operating System":"No Data","Other Requirements":"No Data","Time Scale":"No Data","Spatial Extent":"No Data","Technical Skills Needed":"No Data","Model Structure":"AQUATOX simulates the transfer of biomass, energy and chemicals from one compartment of the ecosystem to another.

AQUATOX can predict not only the environmental fate of chemicals in aquatic ecosystems, but also their direct and indirect effects on the resident organisms. Therefore it has the potential to establish causal links between chemical water quality and biological response and aquatic life uses. AQUATOX differs from most water quality models in several ways. Most models include few if any biological components, whereas AQUATOX is an ecosystem and food web model. It includes not only numerous types of plants, invertebrates and fish, it also can represent the processes by which the biota can affect the chemical/physical environment. AQUATOX is based on object-oriented programming, and uses numerous differential equations to simulate the ecological processes affecting the state variables.

This is of particular importance for the biological parameters, which are probably the most difficult for a user to obtain. We continue to add to these libraries to expand the range of site types, ecological communities and pollutant types. AQUATOX can link to BASINS, EPA's GIS and water quality modeling system.

Through WIL EPA is partnering with: 1) The USFWS and USGS to expand the extent of wetlands mapped nationwide using a consistent national mapping standard, and 2) The USACOE to expand the quality and quantity of data collected regarding impacts to wetlands and other waters of the US authorized in the Clean Water Act (CWA) Section 404 permit program as well as associated mitigation measures required to offset permitted losses. Background and Business Case: Ensuring \"no net loss\" of wetland and other aquatic resource area and function is a fundamental goal of the CWA Section 404 regulatory program. Building on this foundation, the Administration has also articulated a national wetland gain goal to be achieved through voluntary and incentive based wetland restoration and protection programs. In order to meet these goals, it is crucial to know the location and extent of wetland resources and have an understanding of the quality and functions of these wetland resources. Expanding and updating wetland maps in the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's National Wetlands Inventory (NWI) and improving the quality, quantity, and accessibility of aquatic resource impact and compensation data tracked in the U.S. Corps of Engineer's new OMBIL Regulatory Module (ORM) data management system are critical for national reporting and tracking our progress at meeting the no net loss and gain goals. Once wetlands are mapped, assessments can be conducted to monitor wetland health, target voluntary wetland restoration activities, and better manage our CWA Section 404 regulatory responsibilities. Improved NWI data would also facilitate watershed management by improving integration with other water programs (e.g., TMDL, 303(d), Section 319), helping the States, Tribes, local and Federal governments to make better aquatic resource permit decisions, improve public water supply protection, maintain biodiversity, and enhance local land use planning. Goals of WIL 1. To complete a national wetlands GIS data layer for incorporation into the National Map. This layer would be overlaid with the NHD and be accessible in WATERS. Increased understanding of the location of wetland resources will better enable States to organize and implement wetland monitoring and assessment efforts and better equip State and Federal regulators to make informed decisions regarding permitting impacts to wetlands and siting wetland replacement projects. 2. Assist the Corps is upgrading its ORM database to ORM 2.0. Proposed upgrades will expand the quality and quantity of 404 permit program data collected in ORM, expand geo-referencing capabilities, integrate tracking of mitigation banks, ensure EPA access to certain specified data fields, and enable datasharing with States and the public.","Decision Sector":"No Data","URL":"https://ofmext.epa.gov/darter/gov.epa.darter.Darter/","Life Cycle Phase":"Operations and Maintenance","BaseCost":"No Data","AnnualCost":"No Data","Other Cost Considerations":"No Data","Open Source":"No Data","Operating Environment":"No Data","Operating System":"No Data","Other Requirements":"No Data","Time Scale":"No Data","Spatial Extent":"No Data","Technical Skills Needed":"No Data","Model Structure":"No Data","Model Inputs":"No Data","Input Data Requirements":"No Data","Model Output Types":"No Data","Output Variables":"No Data","Model Evaluation":"No Data","Keywords":"Section 404, fill, wetlands","Support Name":"No Data","Support Email":"No Data","Support Phone":"No Data","Support Materials":"No Data","Last Software Update":"No Data","Last Modified":"09/27/2017 03:04:58 PM","Ownership Type":"Shared","Resource Type":"System or Application","Alternate Names":"No Data"},"1091":{"ID":1091,"Title":"Water Contaminant Information Tool","Acronym":"WCIT","Description":"The Water Contaminant Information Tool (WCIT) is a secure, on-line database that provides current, reliable information on chemical, biological, and radiological contaminants of concern for water security.

ECOTOX is the ecological counterpart to IRIS (Integrated Risk Information System), the human health effects database. Both ECOTOX and IRIS provide risk assessors and researchers consistent information on toxic effects of chemical substances. Unlike IRIS, ECOTOX does not provide a single reference value, but does provide a detailed set of toxic effects data that are used in deriving benchmarks (e.g., Water Quality Criteria and Ecological Soil Screening Levels.) ECOTOX is used broadly within EPA to meet a variety of critical regulatory and research needs and is also used by stakeholders and other interested parties outside the Agency. NHEERL's ecotoxicology research effort advances a wide range of Agency ecological effect characterization approaches for chemical stressors under the CWA, TSCA, FIFRA, FQPA, and CERCLA. This includes the challenge of extrapolating effect thresholds and dose-response relationships derived on a handful of species to potential effects on aquatic and wildlife species. To meet Agency risk assessment needs that rely on extrapolations across thousands of chemicals and species, the NHEERL Eco-Divisions are developing an array of modeling approaches. To advance state-of-the-science extrapolation models it is essential that high quality and standardized effects data are readily available. In addition, ECOTOX is used by risk assessors in various Program Offices to prioritize chemical cleanup at hazardous waste sites and assist in the assessment of potential hazards of pollutants through the CAA, FIFRA, CWA, and TSCA. Consequently, various research efforts and Agency risk assessments rely on the ECOTOX knowledge-base as their sole or primary source for ecotoxicity information required to make regulatory decisions consistent with the Agency's Information Quality Guideline provisions. The majority of data in ECOTOX are abstracted from the peer-reviewed literature and EPA research efforts. ECOTOX also includes third-party data collections from the EPA Program Offices, the United States Geologic Survey, Russia, and OECD member nations. The latter sources summarize research published in non-English journals and/or not available in the open literature. Pertinent information on species, chemicals, test methods and toxicity results are encoded into the database. ECOTOX currently includes more than 890,000 test results on the effects of more than 11,320 chemicals on over 12,400 terrestrial and aquatic species. All publications from which ECOTOX data records are derived are retained. The database is updated quarterly. ECOTOX has a robust search engine. The Quick Search allows searches by the most commonly requested parameters: chemical and/or species information, observed effect, and publication year. The Advanced Search includes 17 search parameters, including expanded taxonomic and chemical searching, searches on test results, test conditions, and publication information. Users can customize reports as to format (e.g., spreadsheet vs. HTML) and coded parameters.","Decision Sector":"No Data","URL":"www.epa.gov/ecotox","Life Cycle Phase":"Operations and Maintenance","BaseCost":"No Data","AnnualCost":"No Data","Other Cost Considerations":"No Data","Open Source":"No Data","Operating Environment":"No Data","Operating System":"No Data","Other Requirements":"No Data","Time Scale":"No Data","Spatial Extent":"No Data","Technical Skills Needed":"No Data","Model Structure":"No Data","Model Inputs":"No Data","Input Data Requirements":"No Data","Model Output Types":"No Data","Output Variables":"No Data","Model Evaluation":"No Data","Keywords":"aquatic, ecology, phytotox, terrestrial, terretox, toxicolog","Support Name":"na","Support Email":"ecotox.support@epa.gov","Support Phone":"(218) 525-5225","Support Materials":"No Data","Last Software Update":"No Data","Last Modified":"03/28/2018 02:04:57 AM","Ownership Type":"Internal","Resource Type":"System or Application","Alternate Names":"No Data"},"11194":{"ID":11194,"Title":"Pesticide Registration Information System","Acronym":"PRISM","Description":"The Pesticide Registration Information System (PRISM) provides an integrated, web-enabled portal for all pesticide related data, communications, registrations and transactions for the Office of Pesticide Programs (OPP) and its stakeholders, partners and customers.

Specifically, PRISM supports Objective 4.1, Chemical and Pesticide Risks, by improving OPP's ability to evaluate potential new pesticides; review the safety of older pesticides; register pesticide producing entities; and enforce pesticide requirements. Currently, EPA's mission is supported by the Office of Pesticide Programs Information Network (OPPIN), a group of stand-alone, legacy applications that lack the speed and functionality needed by EPA.

The Down the Drain module uses simple dilution for surface water releases, but only for releases of consumer products into typical Publically Owned Treatment Works. The Consumer module estimates inhalation and dermal exposures. It uses survey information to estimate release amounts per consumer use and user activity patterns. For inhalation, it estimates emissions via the Chinn empirical relationship or a double-exponential equation, depending on the product, then utilizes the Runge-Kutta method to predict time-varying concentration in each of two indoor zones. Dermal exposures are generally estimated using estimated film thickness of chemical product on the surface area exposed.

Each year, the TRI Program collects and analyzes information on toxic chemical releases and waste management practices for over 20,000 U.S. facilities, then compiles the data and makes them available through several Web-based tools. The TRI Program was established in 1986 as part of the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA). The mandate was expanded by the Pollution Prevention Act of 1990 (PPA) to include information on the form, amount, and disposition of toxic materials leaving facilities as waste. The Toxics Release Inventory Processing System (TRIPS) helps fulfill the legislative mandate of collecting toxic chemical information from covered facilities and making it available to the public. General enhancements are typically needed to prepare for the next reporting year facility submissions, which are due by July 1 of each year, and to reflect any OMB-approved changes in the TRI reporting forms (i.e., obtained through the Information Collection Request process).

GAP provides financial and technical assistance to all federally recognized tribes and inter-tribal consortia. For tribes to access funding through GAP, they are required to submit a work plan for each year. These work plans undergo review and negotiation with Project Officers (PO?s) at the EPA Regional offices. The Work Plan must show the area that the tribe wants to work and specify what tasks or activities the tribe will undertake to achieve this. The application is composed of two interrelated components, GAP Online and GAP Offline. The GAP Online system is an Internet-based work plan development application which allows tribal users to complete all aspects of the work plan online and provides a means for the Project Officers to review, comment, negotiate, and accept the work plan. GAP Online also stores documentation with the application such as background narrative information, proposed budgets, supporting documents as well as archived documentation for historical reference. It can also produce progress reports and acts as a repository in which all deliverables pertaining to the tribes activities related to the GAP grants are stored. The GAP Offline application is a sub-set of GAP Online. GAP Offline is an offline web application that allows users to work on the GAP work plan without Internet connectivity. GAP Offline improves application performance by allowing frequently used image and java script files to be stored locally. A continuous Internet connection is not required and work plans are synchronized with the GAP Online server when connection is reestablished. There is currently no other practical means for a comprehensive and timely national overview of the activities and use of resources under GAP. Having the system in place is central to responding to ongoing inquiries from the Office of Management and Budget (PART in FY 2003 and 2007) and the Office of the Inspector General (Audit Report No. 08-P-0083). The completion of a work plan, and reporting on workplan performance are both critical to ensuring that the mission of the program is achieved. Funding cannot be provided to a tribe without an accessible, comprehensive workplan, and future funding is predicated on regular reporting and the written demonstration of regular progress towards capacity building.","Decision Sector":"No Data","URL":"http://iaspub.epa.gov/GAP_Online/","Life Cycle Phase":"Operations and Maintenance","BaseCost":"No Data","AnnualCost":"No Data","Other Cost Considerations":"No Data","Open Source":"No Data","Operating Environment":"No Data","Operating System":"No Data","Other Requirements":"No Data","Time Scale":"No Data","Spatial Extent":"No Data","Technical Skills Needed":"No Data","Model Structure":"No Data","Model Inputs":"No Data","Input Data Requirements":"No Data","Model Output Types":"No Data","Output Variables":"No Data","Model Evaluation":"No Data","Keywords":"AIEO, GAP , GAP Grants, GAP Online, Grants, Indian, Tribal, Tribal Capacity Building, Tribes","Support Name":"No Data","Support Email":"No Data","Support Phone":"No Data","Support Materials":"No Data","Last Software Update":"No Data","Last Modified":"09/21/2017 11:44:08 AM","Ownership Type":"Internal","Resource Type":"System or Application","Alternate Names":"GAP Online; Indian General Assistance Program"},"11728":{"ID":11728,"Title":"Cleanups In My Community II","Acronym":"CIMC II","Description":"This system is a public web application that enables integrated access, through maps, lists and a search capability, to site-specific information EPA has across all our cleanup programs.

These assessments are used as the scientific basis for setting EPA standards. To create these assessments, EPA scientists need to collect, evaluate, and sythesize thousands of scientific publications on a continuing basis. Previously, there has been no systematic, comprehensive, sustainable process for collecting, organizing, summarizing, and making accessible key data from these publications. HERO fills this gap, by gathering data from scientific publications in a systematic manner on an ongoing 'evergreen' basis, systematically categorizing and evaluating them, and providing transparency and on-line accessibility for EPA assessment scientists and stakeholders. Accessible to the public via the EPA web site, HERO contains bibliographic information, as well as corresponding data extracted into a standardized format. In addition, authenticated EPA staff and collaborators have access to additional data and statistical tools. Consistent with the Administration's Open Government Directive, HERO's major aims are transparency and information-sharing among the many stakeholders of EPA's assessment process. As such, HERO is designed to leverage existing and shared resources within EPA and among other Federal agencies. By building the core functions on EPA-standard enterprise-wide platforms, related data sets are linked to the various HERO modules. The generic design choices are aimed at providing maximum flexibility for using HERO for multiple disciplines and subject areas. The HERO System uses repurposed and reusable code modules; and data sharing to reduce development time and costs. Tremendous cost benefits and return on investment are realized in these areas: - Significant labor reduction by using latest technologies to retrieve and store data, rather than manual/analog methods. - Huge reduction in redundant and repetitive data collection and analysis by designing a carefully planned and implemented database modules. - Scheduled deliverables are met in a timely manner. - Open, widespread access to shared data provides stakeholders with needed information.

The model simulates the potential allocation of land over time to competing activities in both the forest and agricultural sectors. In doing this it simulates the potential consequences of different modeled policies for the commodity markets supplied by these lands and the net greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The model was developed to evaluate the welfare and market impacts of public policies and environmental changes affecting agriculture and forestry.

FASOMGHG is dynamic in that it solves for the simultaneous multi-market, multi-period equilibrium across all agricultural and wood product markets, and for all time periods within the specified time horizon. Thus it produces an intertemporal, intersectoral land market dynamic equilibrium. FASOMGHG embodies a nonlinear objective function, representing the sum of producers and consumers surpluses in all of the included product and factor markets. It is price-endogenous because the prices of the products produced and the factor inputs used in the two sectors are determined in the model solution. Finally, FASOMGHG is a mathematical programming model because it uses numerical optimization techniques to find the multi-market price and quantity vectors that simultaneously maximize the value of an objective function, subject to a set of constraints.","Model Inputs":"forestry and agriculture natural science and economic information, related sector/commodity information, GHGs, land use area for more information, see http://agecon2.tamu.edu/people/faculty/mccarl-bruce/FASOM.html","Input Data Requirements":"No Data","Model Output Types":"No Data","Output Variables":"No Data","Model Evaluation":"Brief description and/or references, as available, pertaining to: verification of code; corroboration of model results with observations of real systems; sensitivity analysis; uncertainty analysis; comparisons with other models regarding accuracy and predictive capacity; and any peer review references: 28 years of studies and documentation.

It focuses on sustainable systems and communities. It is flexible but rigorous, transparent and auditable, and adapts to new information. The last part of the DASEES acronym , 'EES' acknowledges that this approach takes into account the environmental, economic, and societal aspects of what have traditionally been defined as just environmental issues. This formalized common sense is referred to in technical circles as 'multi-attribute decision analysis'. These attributes include the many stakeholders that are affected by decisions on environmental issues. Other attributes include the many physical, chemical, and biological aspects of ecosystems.

State-level managers and restoration advocates have expressed a desire for approaches that evaluate wetlands ecosystem services and benefits for two purposes: to demonstrate the benefits of money budgeted for restoration and to compare proposals when awarding restoration funds for specific projects. In addition, our approach may also be used for preliminary screening of projects that require further evaluation, as a template for discussion when making mitigation decisions, and to develop watershed \"report cards\" used to educate the public about the benefits from wetlands in a watershed, and about where these benefits may be at risk. While there are many existing wetlands functional assessment tools (e.g, Wetland Evaluation Technique (WET), Habitat Evaluation Procedures (HEP), Hydrogeomorphic Method (HGM)), they typically do not estimate ecosystem services and benefits explicitly. Furthermore, neither the available wetlands functional assessment tools nor the tools available for environmental cost-benefit analyses are routinely used, because of their complex data requirements. In some cases, comprehensive approaches that address the inherent complexity of wetlands are needed, but there are many situations where a simplified approach can facilitate communication and decision making.","Decision Sector":"No Data","URL":"No Data","Life Cycle Phase":"Development or Acquisition","BaseCost":"No Data","AnnualCost":"No Data","Other Cost Considerations":"No Data","Open Source":"No Data","Operating Environment":"No Data","Operating System":"No Data","Other Requirements":"No Data","Time Scale":"Point in Time","Spatial Extent":"Watershed","Technical Skills Needed":"No Data","Model Structure":"No Data","Model Inputs":"No Data","Input Data Requirements":"No Data","Model Output Types":"No Data","Output Variables":"No Data","Model Evaluation":"No Data","Keywords":"wetland restoration, Woonasquatucket, benefits indicators, s","Support Name":"No Data","Support Email":"No Data","Support Phone":"No Data","Support Materials":"Documentation;Case Studies","Last Software Update":"No Data","Last Modified":"03/28/2018 02:05:03 AM","Ownership Type":"Internal","Resource Type":"System or Application","Alternate Names":"No Data"},"12659":{"ID":12659,"Title":"Water Finance Clearinghouse","Acronym":"WFC","Description":"The Water Finance Clearinghouse (WFC) is a web portal to help communities locate information and resources for making informed decisions for their drinking water, wastewater, and stormwater infrastructure needs.
