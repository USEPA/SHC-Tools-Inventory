The model also captures global market interactions, global timber supply and the associated carbon accounting. It solves in 10 year increments and terminal conditions are imposed after 180 years.

One implication of this formulation is that if future demand is going to increase substantially, economic agents adjust to the anticipate higher future prices by reducing harvests today to be able to increase harvests in the future. This behavior results in shifting harvests from the present to the future. Lower current harvests result in increased current prices, while increased future harvests decrease future prices. Similarly, the expectation of higher future prices will result in increased investments in regeneration today.

The model solution portrays simultaneous market equilibrium over an extended time, typically 40 to 100 years on a five year time step basis. The results from FASOM-GHG yield a dynamic simulation of prices, production, management, consumption, GHG effects, and other environmental and economic indicators within these two sectors, under the chosen policy scenario. The model simulates the potential allocation of land over time to competing activities in both the forest and agricultural sectors. In doing this it simulates the potential consequences of different modeled policies for the commodity markets supplied by these lands and the net greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The model was developed to evaluate the welfare and market impacts of public policies and environmental changes affecting agriculture and forestry. To date, FASOM-GHG and its predecessor models FASOM and ASM have been used to examine the effects of GHG mitigation policy, climate change impacts, public timber harvest policy, federal farm program policy, bioenergy prospects, and pulpwood production by agriculture among other policies and environmental changes.","Decision Sector":"No Data","URL":"http://agecon2.tamu.edu/people/faculty/mccarl-bruce/FASOM.html","Life Cycle Phase":"Operations and Maintenance","Base Cost":"No Data","Annual Cost":"No Data","Other Cost Considerations":"No Data","Open Source":"No Data","Operating Environment":"Browser and Desktop","Operating System":"Windows","Other Requirements":"Other","Time Scale":"Multi-Year","Spatial Extent":" Region and Nation","Technical Skills Needed":" Model Calibration and Other Specialized Knowledge","Model Structure":"FASOMGHGs key endogenous variables include: commodity and factor prices, production, consumption, export and import quantities, land use allocations between sectors, management strategy adoption, resource use, economic welfare measures, producer and consumer surplus, transfer payments, net welfare effects, environmental impact indicators, GHG emission/absorption of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) surface, subsurface, and groundwater pollution for nitrogen, phosphorous, and soil erosion. FASOMGHG is dynamic in that it solves for the simultaneous multi-market, multi-period equilibrium across all agricultural and wood product markets, and for all time periods within the specified time horizon. Thus it produces an intertemporal, intersectoral land market dynamic equilibrium. FASOMGHG embodies a nonlinear objective function, representing the sum of producers and consumers surpluses in all of the included product and factor markets. It is price-endogenous because the prices of the products produced and the factor inputs used in the two sectors are determined in the model solution. Finally, FASOMGHG is a mathematical programming model because it uses numerical optimization techniques to find the multi-market price and quantity vectors that simultaneously maximize the value of an objective function, subject to a set of constraints.","Model Inputs":"forestry and agriculture natural science and economic information, related sector/commodity information, GHGs, land use area for more information, see http://agecon2.tamu.edu/people/faculty/mccarl-bruce/FASOM.html","Input Data Requirements":"No Data","Model Output Types":"No Data","Output Variables":"No Data","Model Evaluation":"Brief description and/or references, as available, pertaining to: verification of code; corroboration of model results with observations of real systems; sensitivity analysis; uncertainty analysis; comparisons with other models regarding accuracy and predictive capacity; and any peer review references: 28 years of studies and documentation.
